# Product Context: Flappy Bird with DQN

## Problem:

*   Creating an AI agent to play Flappy Bird is a challenging task.
*   Training a DQN agent can be computationally expensive, especially for complex environments.

## Solution:

*   Develop a Flappy Bird game environment.
*   Implement a DQN agent to learn to play the game.
*   Optimize the DQN implementation for GPU acceleration to improve training speed.

## User Experience Goals:

*   The user should be able to run the game and observe the DQN agent playing.
*   The user should be able to see the training progress.
*   The user should be able to easily understand the implementation.
*   The training process should be relatively fast.
