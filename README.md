# Flappy Bot
I made this project to try and train an AI to play flappy bird.

# Things I learnt
- Greedy-Epsilon
- DQN
- Double DQN
- Duel DQN

# Things I discovered

I let the AI to train for quite some time with `epsilon = 0.05` and it stopped improving around the average score of 2,
I then set `epsilon = 0.01` and it instantly got to an average score of 3.69 within 1000 episodes
