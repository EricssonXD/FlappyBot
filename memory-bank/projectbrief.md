# Project Brief: Flappy Bird with DQN and GPU Acceleration

## Core Requirements:

*   Implement a Flappy Bird game.
*   Train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to play the game.
*   Optimize the DQN implementation for GPU acceleration.
*   Ensure the game runs and the agent trains effectively.

## Goals:

*   Successfully train a DQN agent to play Flappy Bird.
*   Demonstrate a performance improvement from GPU acceleration.
*   Document the implementation and optimization process.
